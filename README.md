Included in this zip file are a few relevant items:
- `krw_data.csv`: This is the CSV file provided by the assignment. Do not modify it, nor do you need to open it.
- `walters.ipynb`: This is the code file for this assignment.
- `homework.pdf`: This is my written response for this assignment.
- `data`: This folder contains all graphs and CSV files generated as part of this assignment. I will not offer a detailed description here, as my answers in the PDF are already self-explanatory.

My Jupyter file should include all relevant code and diagrams, and you don't need to re-run everything. However, if you want to run everything, I strongly suggest that you open the Jupyter file by launching JupyterLab in a virtual environment (such as anaconda3) in Anaconda Navigator, and also make sure that you have the packages in the first code block. (My understanding is that if you've ever done any programming on Python, you should already have the relevant packages installed, so it should not be a concern.) In addition, the Jupyter file is configured based on relative directories, so you can run the file wherever you put the folder. Do, however, check, and adjust working directory if necessary.

I tried my very best to include all outputs from the code in the LaTeX file, with one very minor exception in Section 2.1. You can see that as you read my answers. For the rest of the assignment, you shouldn't have to refer to my code for answers, unless you want to.
